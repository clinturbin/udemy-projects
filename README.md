## Creative CSS Animations, Transitions And Transforms Course  
Master Advanced CSS Animations, Transitions and Transforms And Practice With More Than 25 Creative Examples.  
Instructor: Ahmed Sadek  

- Section 1: CSS Transition Basics  
    - This section was just adding basic transitions to some buttons  
    - Animateable properties are those that can be expressed by numbers because the browser can interpret intermediate values, such as width, height, border-width, padding, margin, line-height, opacity, etc.
    - We can also animate properties expressed by colors
    - Some properties that can't be animated properly:  
        - backgroundImage, display, border-style, position, float, background-repeat, font-family 
    - See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) for complete list of animateable properties
- Section 2: CSS 2D Transforms  
    - translate(x,y): moves an image along x and y axis  
    - scale(width, height): image size is increased by how ever many times specified for width and height
        - scale(x): width and height will both be scaled by x
        - scaleX(x): adjusts the width
        - scaleY(y): adjusts the height
    - rotate(n+deg): rotate an image by n degrees (20deg rotates 20 degress clockwise)  
        - Note: 'deg' is most often used in the real world but can also use 'turn' and 'grad'
    - skew function:  
        - skewX(30deg) - skews image 30 degrees in the x direction
        - skewY(30deg) - skews image 30 degrees in the y direction
        - skew(xdeg, ydeg) - skews image in x and y direction
    - transform-origin: defaults to center of image
- Section 3: CSS 3D Transforms  
  - Every time you want to work with a 3-D environment, you need to define the perspective first. the perspective CSS property is added to the image container.
  - rotateZ(degs) is actually similar to rotate
  - rotateX(degs): rotate over x axis (rotateX(90deg) will make the image disappear when it is done rotating)
  - rotateY(degs): rotate over y-axis
- Section 4: CSS Transforms Creative Examples  
    - Creative Button Hover Effect (1 - 8)  
    - Image Hover Effect with CSS Transforms (1 - 4)
