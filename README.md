Master Advanced CSS Animations, Transitions and Transforms And Practice With More Than 25 Creative Examples.  
Instructor: Ahmed Sadek  

- Section 1: CSS Transition Basics  
    - This section was just adding basic transitions to some buttons  
    - Animateable properties are those that can be expressed by numbers because the browser can interpret intermediate values, such as width, height, border-width, padding, margin, line-height, opacity, etc.
    - We can also animate properties expressed by colors
    - Some properties that can't be animated properly:  
        - backgroundImage, display, border-style, position, float, background-repeat, font-family 
    - See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) for complete list of animateable properties
